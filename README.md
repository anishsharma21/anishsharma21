- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @anishsharma21
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in computer science, computer architecture, AI and machine learning
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently on my self-guided computer science journey, beginning with digital logic and working my way up to application programming. I've built a number of things but wasn't comfortable with all the layers of abstraction I was neglecting beneath - so, I've decided to learn and build as much as I can from the ground-up. It might not seem like the most 'practical' or 'pragmatic' approach, but I just love computer science and all things to do with programming - my passion and drive for the field trump any short term need for financial success or a stable job. I am just focused on the CS journey to come and all that I will learn (and I'll be documenting it all here on Github!)
