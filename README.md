- 👋 Hi, I’m @anishsharma21
- 👀 I’m interested in programming, software development, computer science, computer architecture, data science, machine learning, and AI
- 🌱 I'm currently on my self-guided computer science journey - beginning with digital logic and working my way to application programming. I decided to embark on this venture because I wasn't comfortable with all the layers of abstraction I was neglecting beneath my surface-level knowledge of framework and microservices - I wanted to build my fundamentals and progress towards mastery in programming and CS.
- 🥅 My immediate goal is to strengthen my skills in data structures and algorithms by learning and applying knowledge from tutorials, textbooks and tonnes of Leetcode problems. My language of choice is python 🐍 because it allows me to move fast and focus on the concepts rather than language semantics.
- 📫 Email me at anisharma2103@gmail.com if you're interested in collaborating or building anything cool!
